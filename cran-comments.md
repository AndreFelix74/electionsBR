We removed "This package..." from the beginning of the Description. Sorry about that.

## Test environments

* Windows (R 3.3.1) Windows 10 (personal computer)
* Ubuntu 12.04 (R 3.1.3-patched), using travis-ci
* Windows (R 3.3.1-patched) using AppVeyor
* Win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 note

* There is only one note on win-builder (devel) about a possibly mispelled word (disaggregated). That is not the case. 

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
